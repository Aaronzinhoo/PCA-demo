### _Utilizing PCA to reduce amount of data needed to process_ 

#### Note: Eigenfaces (eigenvectors used in face recongition) created may be inverted

Principal Componet Analysis (PCA) is a method used to find the most descriptive portions of data. PCA does this by utlizing 
principal componets (PC) which map the greatest degress of varience using Linear Algebra (eigenvecotrs and eigenvalues). 
PCA works optimally under several conditions such centering the data.
This allows us to introduce a matrix approximation technique called SVD decomposition. Under these condtions PCA works exactlty like SVD. 
Once we use SVD on the data, we can create the PC and see how the data maps along the PCs.
